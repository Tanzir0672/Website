  <h3> <p>Fruits are the means by which flowering plants disseminate their seeds.</p> 
    <p>Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans</p> 
    <p>Animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group</p> 
    <p>Nutrition for the other; in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.</p> 
    <p>Consequently, fruits account for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output</p>
